Later, the Spartans employed the &quot;scytale,&quot; a transposition cipher using a rod to rearrange letters. Perhaps most famously, Julius Caesar used a substitution cipher, shifting letters of the alphabet by a fixed amount. These methods, while basic, laid the foundation for the complex cryptographic systems used today, emphasizing the fundamental principles of concealing information through transformation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><div data-test-id="sources-carousel-source"><br></div>
